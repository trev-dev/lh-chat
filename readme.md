## Basic Socket.io Chat Program
I got to learn the basics of how to do this thanks to [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/)

Some key differences between how the did it and how I did it:

* Use pug view engine instead of a static folder for everything
* Use routes to render the template
* Actually get the initials from the chat box.
* Message notification sound added on emit
* Use JSON object strings to handle messaging
* Improved message box style
